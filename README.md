# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Instructions Panel: This is where the user will see the coding challenges. We can start by creating a simple component that displays a static challenge. Later, we can make it dynamic so it can display different challenges.

Navigation Bar: You mentioned that you have a rudimentary navigation bar set up. We can refine this and make sure it allows the user to navigate through the different parts of the app smoothly.

GameWorld: We've already started on this with the wizard selection. We can further develop this component to display the wizard sprite and any other game elements.

Coding Console: We've set up the basic functionality, but as you mentioned, it will need to be repositioned and resized. We can also consider adding more features, like error handling and feedback for the user when they run their code.

User Authentication: This is a larger feature that involves setting up a backend to handle user registration and login. We can use a service like Firebase for this, which provides user authentication out of the box.

Coding Challenges: This is the core of your app. We'll need to come up with a set of challenges for the user to solve. Each challenge will need a description, a set of tests, and a solution for validation.

Testing and Refinement: Throughout the development process, we'll need to continuously test the app to make sure everything is working as expected. We'll also need to refine the UI and UX based on feedback and testing.

Deployment: Once everything is working and looking good, we can deploy the app to a hosting service like Netlify or Vercel.
